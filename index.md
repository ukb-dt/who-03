# From Human Intelligence to Living Systems

## [Human Intelligence](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-hi/)
The current reality: inverted pyramid of effort

- **Conclusion**: WHO policy briefs, guidelines—outputs that shape nations
- **Limitations**: Time, bias, scale, burnout—constraints that distort evidence
- **Results**: 1 report, 1 officer, 1 deadline missed—the compression of months into moments
- **Methods**: PubMed → Embase → 10,000 abstracts → 3 months—the ritualistic grind
- **Background**: What we know, what we don't—the soil from which everything grows

## [AI Pentad](https://ukb-dt.github.io/ai-types-00/)
Five emergent layers—from embodied wisdom to world's raw data

| Layer | Role in Evidence Synthesis |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **[Embodied AI](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-ideal/)** | Audits the entire workflow—bias detection, equity checks, PRISMA compliance |
| **[Generative AI](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-rank/)** | Synthesizes findings into reports, policy briefs, and insights (Litmaps, Undermind) |
| **Agentic AI** | Automates screening, extraction, and repetitive tasks (Rayyan, ASReview, Scispace) |
| **Perception AI** | Ingests literature across journals, languages, and grey sources (Elicit, Semantic Scholar) |
| **World AI** | Understands global health patterns, NCDs, TB, AYUSH foundations—the raw environment |

- **Context varies by layer** → Tools aligned with AI type
- **No standard classification exists** → Ours is rooted in [topology of engineered systems](https://ukb-dt.github.io/ai-types-01/) (TOES)
- **Living pattern**: `O)-(O` found in trees, lungs, airports—and now, evidence workflows

## [WHO-India](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-india/)
Not global. Not generic. Policy outputs rooted in Indian soil.

### Vocabulary Beyond "AI Tools"
Not extraction → **Nervous system**  
Not automation → **Living workflow**  
Not efficiency → **Co-adaptation between human and machine intelligence** (Embodied AI—the apex)

### Invariant Aspects of Science & Public Health
- Evidence must be **found** → Perception AI locates
- Bias must be **named** → Embodied AI audits
- Gaps must be **acted on** → Generative AI synthesizes

### Tailored to WHO-India's Workflow
- 700+ officers needing evidence at policy speed
- PRISMA compliance without bureaucratic friction
- Equity embedded in every filter, not bolted on

### Journal & Language Agnostic  
Hindi, Tamil, grey literature, field notes—every voice heard (Perception AI)

### Literature Most Relevant to India
NCDs, TB, AYUSH, UHC—the Indian epidemiological landscape (World AI foundation)

## The Trajectory

**From**: Background → Methods → Results → Limitations → Conclusion (Human Intelligence, inverted pyramid crushing the officer)  
**To**: World AI (India's data) → Perception AI (ingest everything) → Agentic AI (automate workflows) → Generative AI (synthesize insights) → Embodied AI (audit for equity) → **WHO Policy Outputs**

**This isn't AI for AI's sake.**  
This is **your evidence, your language, your impact**—[faster](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-hi-00/), fairer, scalable.

Like the OpenAI revenue chart: small foundation (2023), explosive emergence through layers, with **Agents and New Products** (Embodied AI) driving apex growth to $125B.
