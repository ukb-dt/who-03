## [WHO-India](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-india/)

### Conclusions: [Vocabulary](https://ukb-dt.github.io/gpu/) Beyond "AI Tools"
Policy outputs rooted in Indian soil → **Co-adaptation between human and machine intelligence**  

### Limitations: Invariant Aspects of Science & Public Health
- Bias must be **named** → Embodied AI audits
- Gaps must be **acted on** → Generative AI synthesizes
- Evidence must be **found** → Perception AI locates

### Results: [Tailored](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-c/) to WHO-India's Workflow
- Equity embedded in every filter, not bolted on
- PRISMA compliance without bureaucratic friction
- 700[+](https://ukb-dt.github.io/n/) officers needing evidence at policy speed

### Methods: Journal & Language Agnostic  
Hindi, Tamil, grey literature, field notes—every voice heard ([Perception AI](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-b/))

### Background: [Literature](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-a/) Most Relevant to India
